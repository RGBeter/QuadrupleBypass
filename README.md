# Quadruple Bypass
Update to the triple bypass mod for the genesis with on board mono audio, composite and S-Video generation for all models, ensuring complete functionality of the din for all genesis systems.

Also adds a ZIF connector for a future ribbon cable design to greatly simplify installation

(instructions pending, same as 3bp install except composite and mono must also be isolated from the din, and the subcarrier line must be routed to the 4bp)
### When routing the subcarrier line, make sure it's a shielded coaxial cable or twisted pair to prevent jailbars
